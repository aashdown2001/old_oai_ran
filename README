================================================================================
Frequency Band
--------------
The config by default is set to run the gNB in band 78 at 3619.20 MHz. In Colosseum use the RF scenario 10011 as it runs at 3.62 GHz.

Deploying OAI in 5G Standalone Mode with OAI 5G core network:
------------------------------------------------------------

Running gNB:
-----------
sa_gnb_run.sh: This script can be used to run gNB in end-to-end SA mode. This 
script first detects and sets the route towards the core network docker
containers. The script then updates the gNB config file with the IP address of
the col0 interface which gNB uses to communicate with the core network.  

The gNB config file is located at openairinterface5g/targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-NR-5GC/CONF/gnb.sa.band78.fr1.106PRB.usrpb210.conf.

The gNB log file is stored at the location ~/mylogs

Running NR UE (separate host than gNB):
--------------------------------------
sa_nrue_run.sh: This script runs NR UE in end-to-end SA mode

After the UE successfully registers with the core network and a PDU session is
created, the UE is assigned an IP address. To check the UE IP address, run:
$ ifconfig oaitun_ue1

In SA mode, after UE is assigned an IP address and before starting user-plane
traffic, use the following command to set the default route at host running UE
to route the traffic through OAI core network.
$ route add default gw 12.1.1.1

sa_nrue1_run.sh, sa_nrue2_run.sh, sa_nrue3_run.sh: These scripts can be used to run additional instances of NR UE (on separate SRNs) to run experiments with multiple UEs. The scripts use the command line option '--uicc0.imsi' to specify a different IMSI value for each UE.

The nrUE log file is stored at the location ~/mylogs

================================================================================
Deploying OAI in "noS1" mode:
----------------------------

nos1_gnb_run.sh: Runs OAI gNB in "noS1" mode

nos1_nrue_run.sh: Runs OAI UE in "noS1" mode

Log files are stored at the location ~/mylogs
